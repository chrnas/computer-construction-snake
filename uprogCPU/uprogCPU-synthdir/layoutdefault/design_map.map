    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     12
      Number with same-slice register load:     10
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   233 out of   2,278   10%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       164 out of   4,556    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          693
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           314 out of     693   45%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              69 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
